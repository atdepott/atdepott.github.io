### Terry Pratchett, 2004

I first read this book when I was in high school, probably soon after it just came out.  I worked at a library throughout high school, where my job consisted of: 
- hand-cutting letters out of construction paper to decorate the windows for monthly themed art displays 
- shelving books 
- whatever odds and ends were need (such as moving books, culling old books, removing sticky residue from books, filing library card applications, sending faxes for $2/page, setting up for book sales, etc.)
- when I was very lucky, working the front desk

It paid slightly more than minimum wage, and I worked something like 12 hours a week.  I was not really in it for the money, though - I was in it for the books.  As I shelved, I covertly read book jackets and backs (and sometimes... the actual book, which I felt VERY GUILTY about).  I am fairly sure that this is how I was first introduced to Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, and this was my first (or second?) foray into the series.

I re-read _Going Postal_ while waiting in line to get my first dose of the covid vaccine.   I was very impatient about it and scheduled the first available appointment on the day that eligibility opened up, even though I knew it was going to be a long wait at this particular location.  I found out the next day that if I had been a little more patient, I could have gotten an in-and-out appointment at the work cafeteria, but I did not do that.  So I waited in a 2-hour line behind a couple who seemed to possibly be on a second or third date (they didn't know each other very well), and started my re-read for the first time since 2004.

The Discworld series is well-known, but if you haven't heard of them: they manage to be both a satire of your standard fantasy tropes, while also being very sincere and earnest.  They're mostly funny and a little bit sweet and sometimes exciting.  There are a lot of them, with a lot of sub-series (wizards, Inspector Vimes, Death, witches, etc.)  _Going Postal_ is the first book to feature Moist von Lipwig, a ex-conman who is condemmed to re-establish Ankh-Morpork's failed Postal Service.  Although there are some cameos of other established characters, it works as a stand-alone, and as such it is a good introduction to Discworld.

The first thing I love about this book, of course, is that it is about tidying up something - figuratively, the postal system; literally, the post office building.  You have not been reading this blog for very long and you already should know that I love a book with a good tidying plot.

The second thing is that _Going Postal_ is very good at describing the feeling of pure adrenaline and joy that is produced by the perfect mixture of doing something that you absolutely love and and are definately very good at, with exact ratio of external pressure.  The concept of "flow" is a popular topic these days, but what I'm describing goes beyond flow into something more transcendant.  The second half of any given Great British Bakeoff season exemplifies this, for me - a tent half-full of very good bakers, giving their absolute all to make the perfect three-tier cake decorated only with pomagrante and lime peels.  If I'm lucky, I get to experience this ultra-flow feeling maybe once a year, when something is on the line at work and I lose track of everything else in my life to make it happen.  It's like Daft Punk's Tron: Legacy soundtrack is beating in your veins.  It is a heady feeling.

The reason I waited so long to write this post is that I was afraid that I could not write about this amazing feeling without sounding like I am bragging about my professional skills.   Please do not start thinking I am an insufferable know-it-all; I am acutely aware of many of my professional weaknesses and failings.  Also, there have been many times in my life when the pressure was on and I barely held it together, and that is, frankly, a terrible feeling.  

But that's not this book!  This book is about jumping off the post office and making plans as you're flying through the air.  It is about inventing the stamp collecting hobby, and the internet if it was done via telegraph, and a golem collective working to free their kind.  It is light-hearted and heart-warming and it helped me to enjoy my time in the vaccination line.
