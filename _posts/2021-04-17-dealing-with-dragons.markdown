### Patricia C. Wrede, 1990

I have been having a hard time making myself write the second post for this blog, due to the hazy nature of the goals for this blog.  I have decided that I am not writing book reviews, and neither am I trying to convince you to read the book.  I am also not going to write book club guides.  So what does that leave? I sadly realized that I had hoped to write intelligent, funny, and enthralling short essays to examine the chosen book, discuss related topics at hand, and ultimately  interrogate the very act of reading and loving books.  Obviously this is too much pressure.  I haven’t taken an English class since high school, remember, and the essays were not my strength even then. 

So: here is a purposefully mediocre blog post.  I am taking my own advice that practice makes progress, and so the topic of the day is a children’s book that I read as a child and then also read tonight, as a 33-year old childless adult.  _Dealing With Dragons_, by Patricia C. Wrede, book one of the Enchanted Forest Chronicles.  

About the physical book: I purchased it off Better World Books, an online book website that promises to give books to developing countries (I am not clear on the details) but most importantly has very, very cheap used books.  This book cost less than $5 with free shipping.  It does have stamps inside from The Classical Academy Library in Colorado Springs and is covered in the sticky residue that you find when you peel packing tape off a book.  It is very clearly a used book.  

I still have the second and third books in the series from my childhood, but somewhere along the way I lost the first one, and then I lent the fourth one to a friend and moved away and I have absolutely no hard feelings about this.  This is not sarcasm. (I know it can be hard to tell via the written word).  Books come and go, and I believe in a sort of mystical or spiritual force that connects people with books when they need them.  I hope she enjoyed the book.  Also, I bought a replacement from Better World Books for $3.65. 

What is the topic of this book?  As the title suggests, dragons play a prominent part in the plot.  The protagonist is again a sensible, down-to-earth young woman, although in this case she is titled nobility: Princess Cimorene.  (As a side note, I just looked this name up, and it is unique to this book.  Good cat name.)  She escapes her predictable life / arranged engagement and stumbles into employment as a sort of housekeeper to a dragon.  As you would expect, the plot involves magic and wizards and the dragon, and also organizational skills.  The book is uncomplicated - it only has 212 pages and is scored at a 3rd grade reading level - but examines traditional fairy tale tropes with a refreshingly sensible tone.  This has obviously been done many times now (the Shrek franchise, etc) but I personally find this particular iteration delightful, or at the very least, nostalgic.

I have read the second and third books in the series more times than the first book.  (I address this topic in the rambling paragraphs about my physical copy of this book.)  I remember those books being better - more complex, a less obvious plot, more developed characters.  This could be because I haven’t read them for several years, or it could be that it just takes some time for an author to get her legs under her.  (Much like this blog.)
