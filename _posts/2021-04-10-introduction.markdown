Hello, everyone.

My name is Ashley and I am a person who reads.  I don’t really read a lot, compared to some people, and I don’t really know a lot about books, compared to some people.  I work as a software developer and am generally unqualified to write a blog about books.  

However: I really, really love reading. And libraries, and book stores, and the general idea of books.  Also, for reasons unknown to me, I can read fiction books really fast (not textbooks).  This has not been useful for anything in my life thus far, and the unfortunate side effect of this is that I only read books when I can finish the book in one sitting.  I don’t read before bed or read a few chapters over my lunch break, otherwise I will go to bed at 1 am, or take an unplanned afternoon off work.

I don’t talk about books with very many people in my life right now.  So I’m starting this blog, regardless of my qualifications, to talk about books into the void.  A nice side effect of this blog might be if one of you starts talking to me about books in real life.  (This applies to people who know me in real life -- I assume this is all of you, unless I have found an unexpected measure of success). But mostly, I just want to talk about books that I love.

My plan for this blog is to talk about one book per post.  I will start with the books that I really, really love and have read many times.  These will not be hot new titles off the presses.  They will be the opposite of that.  I will not have any great insights.  My last English class was in 12th grade and I was not particularly strong at that kind of thing.  (My strength in academics has always been the multiple-choice test.)  It will just be me, Ashley, a tall lady who reads fast, journaling about my love for books.
