### Stella Gibbons, 1932

This is my favorite book.  People who know that I sometimes attend Jane Austen Society meetings may be surprised, since people who pay $75 to go to a day-long series of lectures on the work and legacy of Jane Austen (with optional cosplay) often cite her as their favorite.  The librarians at the AK Smiley Public Library, who mostly see me check out contemporary romance novels, may be surprised.  Childhood friends, who experienced me as being VERY into fantasy novels, may be surprised.  My sister, who thinks I primarily read boring mystery novels set in post-war Britain,  actually should not be surprised because I’ve tried to convince her to read this book many times. 

One of the reasons she has not read this book is probably the [cover of my copy](https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9780140188691-us.jpg).  It looks like it is included in the AP Lit reading list.  It is bland and depicts people pointing and holding shirts? They look vaguely unhappy, and rural, which is actually relevant to the story.  Additionally, it is a Penguin Twentieth Century Classic, which generally seems to mean “not fun”.  

Now for the pitch why you should read this book.  Actually, never mind.  I am not doing that on this blog.  You probably have enough sources of book recommendations in your life: the Goodreads algorithm, Barnes and Noble emails, Reese Witherspoon, Oprah, BookTube, BookTok, etc.  This blog is a place for me to write about my feelings about books, not a place for me to convince you to read books that I like.  I would always be happy to hear what you have to recommend, though.  I may not read them and please do not be offended if that happens.  I do read 30-50 books a year but most of those are contemporary romance novels (from the library) and books I’ve read before.

Flora Poste, educated and sensible, has recently been orphaned without much money.  You do not need to worry about her emotional state; Flora takes everything in stride.  She is fine, except she needs a place to live, which she finds with some distant cousins in rural Sussex.  She arrives to find, essentially, a Bronte novel - a family rent by every kind of emotional crisis known to the 1930’s novelist, presided over by the mysterious Aunt Ada Doom.  “There have always been Starkadders at Cold Comfort Farm” is the unofficial motto of the place, so you can see what kind of vibe she is dealing with.  People brood.  They storm.  They wail.  And so on.  Flora, upon arriving, finds a way to wash her room’s dusty curtains, and goes on from there.  That is all that I will say about the plot of this book.

I would say that _Cold Comfort Farm_ has three kinds of moods: satirical drama (see above), satirical sensible-ness (see Flora, and general absurdity.  I personally do not get much from the absurd sections of the novel - the whole thing with the cows’ lost limbs is a little bit baffling to me - but I know of people who think it is the best part.  I will say that it does kind of provide a break in tone, like drinking orange juice when you’re eating something greasy.  

There are two parts in this book that reference things that were not possible/did not happen in the 1930’s.  This is because Stella Gibbons set the novel in the “near future” and she made some predictions about technological and business advances that did not actually come to pass in the 1930’s.  One is airplane taxis, which are a taxi service but with airplanes.  The second is video calls. 

I like this book for the following reasons:  it is funny, features a sensible protagonist who tidies things, and makes me feel smart when I read it.  It is my favorite book.  The cover does not do it justice.
